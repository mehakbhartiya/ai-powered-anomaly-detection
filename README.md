# AI-Powered Anomaly Detection for Logs

## Project Overview
This project implements an innovative AI-powered anomaly detection system designed to analyze application logs in real-time, identifying unusual patterns and potential issues before they escalate into significant problems. By harnessing machine learning algorithms, this system enhances application reliability and maintainability, allowing developers to focus on delivering quality software. In this README, you'll find a comprehensive guide on setting up, running, and contributing to the project, ensuring a seamless experience for users and developers alike.

## Prerequisites
To successfully execute this project, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your machine along with a basic understanding of Python programming and machine learning concepts. Additionally, access to a terminal or command line interface is essential for executing commands and scripts throughout the setup and execution processes.

## Setup Instructions
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/mehakbhartiya/AI-Powered-Anomaly-Detection-for-Logs.git`. Once cloned, navigate to the project directory with `cd AI-Powered-Anomaly-Detection-for-Logs` and create a virtual environment to manage dependencies effectively. You can achieve this by running `python3 -m venv venv` and activating it with `source venv/bin/activate`. After setting up the virtual environment, install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This step ensures that all necessary packages are available for the project to run smoothly.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories for easy navigation and functionality:
- **data/**: This folder contains sample log files utilized for both training and testing the machine learning model.
- **notebooks/**: Here, youâ€™ll find Jupyter notebooks dedicated to exploratory data analysis and model training, offering a clear visual representation of the data and model performance.
- **src/**: This directory houses the source code responsible for data preprocessing, model training, and the core anomaly detection functionality.
- **models/**: Trained machine learning models are stored in this folder for easy access and deployment.

## Running the Project
To initiate the project, start by preprocessing the log data by executing the script located in `src/preprocess.py`. Following this step, train the machine learning model using the script found in `src/train.py`. Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance by running `src/evaluate.py`, which will display accuracy metrics and other relevant performance indicators.

To observe the anomaly detection in action, utilize the `src/detect_anomalies.py` script by providing a log file for analysis. The script will output any detected anomalies, along with their corresponding timestamps, giving you insights into potential issues within your application logs.

## Enhancements
To further elevate this project, consider implementing additional features such as integrating the model into a web application for real-time log analysis, adding visualization tools to graphically represent detected anomalies over time, or incorporating alerting mechanisms to notify developers or system administrators immediately when anomalies are detected. These enhancements not only improve functionality but also provide a more robust solution for monitoring application health.

## Conclusion
The AI-powered anomaly detection system stands as a valuable tool for maintaining application health by proactively identifying potential issues before they escalate. By following the detailed instructions outlined in this README, you can efficiently set up, run, and contribute to the project. We encourage you to explore and expand upon the functionalities presented here, enhancing both your learning experience and the project's capabilities.
